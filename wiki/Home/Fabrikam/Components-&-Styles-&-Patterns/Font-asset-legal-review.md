## 1. Icons: A custom-built subset of Fabric MDL.

This is the set of icons our customers will see and use in the "Fabrikam" sample store implementation. The plan is to pack a subset of Fabric MDL icons into a single woff/woff2 file for use in browser with the following glyph names:

```
Heart
HeartFill
CalculatorSubtract
CalculatorAddition

The official [icon tool](https://uifabricicons.azurewebsites.net/) will be used for creating such subset.

## 2. Texts: Google Fonts
We are using the following from Google font:
1. Assisstant: https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Assistant
2. Cinzel: https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Cinzel
3. Allerta: https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Allerta

They will be hosted by Google CDN and distributed under Open Font License (OFL): https://opensource.org/licenses/OFL-1.1

Here is a pixel preview of their usage:
1. Assistant:

## 3. Logo: Google font converted into image
We used two Google fonts in our design tool and converted them into the "Fabrikam" logo.
1. The "F" is Uncial Antiqua https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Uncial+Antiqua
2. The "abrikam" is Yeseva One https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Yeseva+One

Here is the logo image:
