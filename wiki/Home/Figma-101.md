# Why (not) Figma

We use Figma because it allows designers to quickly build reusable design components that maps to components in code repository while collaborating with other designers. It also provides self-service for developers to get css properties, sizing, and visual asset.

Figma is a tool that improves collaboration and communication but does not _replace_ collaboration or communication. If you have questions about a piece of design, please reach out to the designer. We are always happy to help!

# Install Figma

Figma runs in the browser (Figma.com) but we recommend install its desktop app because of better performance and additional features. [Download Figma desktop app here](https://www.figma.com/downloads/).

# Open files

## Zooming
Hold `Ctrl` key while operating the scroll wheel on your mouse. Experiment with where you position your mouse while zooming. You can get around by solely using this gesture.

## Panning (moving around)
Use the middle mouse button (or scroll wheel) to drag the screen.
Alternatively, hold `Space` key and drag the screen with left mouse button.
